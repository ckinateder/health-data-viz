# 4-Panel Visualization

![4-Panel Visualization](view.png)

"""
For documentation: assume that someone is encountering your project for the first time. 

Explain the motivation for your application.  What can it allow someone to understand? 
- 1 section on the data: Describe the data and include a link. 
- 1 section on any sketches that you used to help design your visualization environment.  (optional- we haven't practiced sketching in class, yet)
- 1 section on the visualization components: Explain each view of the data, the GUI, etc.  Explain how you can interact with your application, and how the views update in response to these interactions. 
- 1 section on what your application enables you to discover: Present some findings you arrive at with your application. 
 1 section on your process- what libraries did you use?  How did you structure your code?  How can you access it and run it?  Link to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed online). 
- UPDATE: optional- perhaps you struggled with the project and learned a lot, but maybe there wasn't quite time to create the project you hoped to have.  It may feel like you don't have as much to write in your documentation, so you can include
    - 'future works' section where you describe what you wanted to do
    - 'challenges' section, where you describe what technical difficulties you encountered while doing this project, and reflect on how you might approach future projects.
- Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in action.  The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover or video captions to explain your application.  Demo videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your documentation.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your webpage.
